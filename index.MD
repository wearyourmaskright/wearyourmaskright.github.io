# Wear Your Mask Right.

Wearing a mask could be difficult for first-timers. Fear not, we are here to help.

Before we start, just make sure your mask and hands are clean (did you sing a birthday song when you wash your hands with SOAP?), and you are wearing it in a clean environment. 

All good? Let’s get started.

First, inspect if the mask has any hole or tear, if there’s one, get another one, as it will not be as protective as it should be. 

Then you'd need to know which side is the “outer layer” of the mask, usually, that would be the coloured side of the mask. 

Found it? Good, then you will need to find the metal strip, that’s the top of the mask. The metal strip will allow the mask to fit your face. 

Okay! You are ready to put on your mask. Assuming you are using a mask with ear loops, hold your mask with the ear loop, then place the loop around your ear. Remember the coloured-side is the outside of the mask.

Once you have put the mask on, adjust the mask to the shape of your nose by slightly bending the metal strip on top of the mask. 

Once you have put it on, pull the bottom of the mask down to your chin, make sure it covers your nose, mouth and your chin. It is a good time to check if the mask is fitted closely to your face - if you wear glass and if it fogs up when you breathe - it is unfitted. Simply adjust the metal strip again!
