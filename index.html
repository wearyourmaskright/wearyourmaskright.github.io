        <h1 class="mt-5">Wear Your Mask Right!</h1>
        <p class="lead"> Wearing a mask could be difficult for first-timers. 
          Fear not, we are here to help. Before we start, just make sure your
          mask and hands are clean (did you sing a birthday song when you wash
          your hands with SOAP?), and you are wearing it in a clean environment.
          <br>All good? Let’s get started.
        </p>
       
<ol class="list-inline-item">
  <li>First, inspect if the mask has any hole or tear, if there’s one, get another one, as it will not be as protective as it should be.
    </li>
  <li>Then you'd need to know which side is the “outer layer” of the mask, usually, that would be the coloured side of the mask.
    </li>
  <li>Found it? Good, then you will need to find the metal strip, that’s the top of the mask. The metal strip will allow the mask to fit your face.
    </li>
  <li>Okay! You are ready to put on your mask. Assuming you are using a mask with ear loops, hold your mask with the ear loop, then place the loop around your ear. Remember the coloured-side is the outside of the mask.
    </li>
  <li>Once you have put the mask on, adjust the mask to the shape of your nose by slightly bending the metal strip on top of the mask.
    </li>
  <li>Once you have put it on, pull the bottom of the mask down to your chin, make sure it covers your nose, mouth and your chin. It is a good time to check if the mask is fitted closely to your face - if you wear glass and if it fogs up when you breathe - it is unfitted. Simply adjust the metal strip again!
    </li>
</ol>
